Econometric analysis on the effect of university expenditure on graduates' incomes

As part of my economics degree I comlpeted a dissertation with the title "What is the effect of university expenditure on graduates' incomes?".
Here I make my dataset public, as well as the code I used to analyse the data in Stata. I have also uploaded my dissertation in full.

The dataset combines offical data about graduates' incomes and university expenditure data which I got from universities' financial statements.
